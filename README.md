# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Chili Labs homework

This is a homework for Chili Labs by Ruslan Rezanov.

## Contribution

For folder architecture I've used [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md).

For logo and favicon [Chili Labs](https://chililabs.io/).

For fake API special thanks to [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products).

## App startup

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Check node and npm using `node -v` or `npm -v`.
3. Git clone the project.
4. Open terminal in {{root}} folder and type `npm i`.
5. Type `npm run dev`, wait for the build and enter `localhost{{PORT}}` to the browser url (default port is `5173`).

## Bonus tasks that weren't completed
